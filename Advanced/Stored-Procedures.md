# ðŸ“Œ SQL Stored Procedures

A **Stored Procedure** is a precompiled SQL code block that can be executed multiple times. It helps in improving performance, reducing redundancy, and enhancing security.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Stored Procedures?
- âœ… Code reusability
- âœ… Improved performance due to precompilation
- âœ… Better security (restricts direct table access)
- âœ… Reduces network traffic by executing multiple queries at once

## ðŸ”¹ Creating a Stored Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllEmployees()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

This stored procedure, when executed, retrieves all records from the `employees` table.

## ðŸ”¹ Executing a Stored Procedure
```sql
CALL GetAllEmployees();
```

## ðŸ”¹ Stored Procedure with Parameters
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDepartment(IN dept_name VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = dept_name;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

To execute it:
```sql
CALL GetEmployeeByDepartment('IT');
```

## ðŸ”¹ Stored Procedure with Output Parameters
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount(OUT emp_count INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO emp_count FROM employees;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

Executing it:
```sql
CALL GetEmployeeCount(@total);
SELECT @total;
```
